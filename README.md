# AO3 Enhancements

This is a browser addon which adds various configurable tweaks and enhancements to the fanfiction website [ArchiveOfOurOwn.org](https://archiveofourown.org).

## Installation

[Install from AMO]()

A chrome/opera/edge version should be doable if reqeusted.

## Current enhancements/features

- Adds **Reading time** and **Finish reading at** to works and even each chapter.
- Shows **Kudos/Hits ratio**, making it easier to find the amazing works.
- Allows **hiding works** when searching/browsing, based on:
  - The language of the work, *or*
  - How many fandoms the work is in (is it a crossover?)
- Various **style customizations**: (only the 1 for now)
  - Adjust the width of a work, making reading on large displays easier.

Most of these features are disabled by default. After installation go to [ArchiveOfOurOwn.org](https://archiveofourown.org) and click the new menu button *"AO3 Enhancements Options"* to go to the options screen.
