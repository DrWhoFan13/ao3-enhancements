# AO3 Enhancements

This is a browser addon which adds various configurable tweaks and enhancements to the fanfiction website [ArchiveOfOurOwn.org](https://archiveofourown.org).

## Installation

[Install from AMO]()

Most of the work for a chrome/opera/edge version is done, it just hasn't been released. A release should be entirely be doable if reqeusted.

## Current enhancements/features

- Adds **Reading time** and **Finish reading at** to works and even each chapter.
- Shows **Kudos/Hits ratio**, making it easier to find the amazing works.
- Allows **hiding works** when searching/browsing, based on:
  - The language of the work, *and/or*
  - How many fandoms the work is in (is it a crossover?), *and/or*
  - Is it written by certain authors?, *and/or*
  - Does it have certain tags?
- Various **style customizations**: (only the 1 for now)
  - Adjust the width of a work, making reading on large displays easier.

Furthermore i strive to make the addon at least as accessible as AO3 itself. Please do report an issue if that is not the case.

Most of these features are disabled by default. After installation go to [ArchiveOfOurOwn.org](https://archiveofourown.org) and click the new menu button *"AO3 Enhancements Options"* to go to the options screen.
