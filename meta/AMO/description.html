Furthermore i strive to make the addon at least as accessible as AO3 itself.
Please do report an issue if that is not the case.

Most of these features are disabled by default.
After installation go to <a href="https://archiveofourown.org">ArchiveOfOurOwn.org</a> and click the new menu button <em>“AO3 Enhancements Options”</em> to go to the options screen.

The icon is a combination of the AO3 logo (svg version from IconFinder), and the Gear icon from the Octicons pack by Github.

This addon is inspired by various userscripts that i used to use to make the AO3 experience better:

<ul>
  <li>
